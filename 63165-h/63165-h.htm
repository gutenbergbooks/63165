<h1>CRIMSON CLOVER: GROWING THE CROP.</h1>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2 style="page-break-before: avoid;"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>Probably the most important characteristic of crimson clover is
its ability to grow and make its crop during the season when the
land is not occupied by the ordinary summer-growth crops. In
sections where it succeeds, crimson clover can be sown following a
grain crop or in an intertilled crop in late summer and will mature a
hay crop the following spring in time to plow the land for spring-seeded
crops, such as corn or cotton. It may even be held for seed
as far north as central Delaware and the stubble be plowed under in
time for seeding the quick-maturing strains of corn. It may be
turned under for soil improvement when only 6 inches high if it Is
desired to fit the land for early spring-seeded crops Even if only
the stubble be turned under, the effect upon the succeeding crop will
be marked, especially if the soil be deficient in nitrogenous fertilizers.
The plowing under of the entire plant, however, will more rapidly
correct any deficiency of nitrates or humus in the soil. It is one of
the best cover crops for use in orchards and, in fact, under any conditions
where the soil is likely to wash during the winter months. The
many uses to which this crop may be put merit a careful study of the
best methods of establishing ii stand of crimson clover upon a farm.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="HISTORY_AND_PRESENT_DISTRIBUTION_OF_CRIMSON_CLOVER" id="HISTORY_AND_PRESENT_DISTRIBUTION_OF_CRIMSON_CLOVER">HISTORY AND PRESENT DISTRIBUTION OF CRIMSON CLOVER.</a></h2>


<p>Crimson clover (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) is frequently called "Scarlet clover" and,
somewhat loss commonly, "German clover," "Italian clover,"
"French clover," "Incarnate clover," "Annual clover," etc. It
occurs wild in England and in eastern and southern Europe and is
grown as a forage and soil-improving crop in Italy, France, Germany,
Austria, and Great Britain. It was introduced into this country as
early as 1822, but was grown only to a very limited extent until about
1880. It has proved especially adapted to the lighter, sandy soils
of the eastern part of the United States where the winters are not
too severe.</p>

<p>In the Middle Atlantic States it is also grown to a considerable
extent on the clay soils of the Piedmont section.</p>

<p>In Michigan it is sometimes used on the sandy soils as a cover crop
in peach orchards, although it frequently winterkills. It can not
ordinarily survive the severe winters of the Northern States.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In such northern sections where a fall-seeded legume is desired it is suggested that hairy vetch seeded
with rye be used instead. See Farmers' Bulletin 515, entitled "Vetches."</p>

</div>

<p>Crimson clover is a "winter annual," that is, it ordinarily makes
its early growth in the autumn, passes the winter in a somewhat dormant
but green state, makes a very early spring growth, and matures
its seed and dies before summer. It makes little or no growth in
very hot weather and therefore should not be sown in the spring,
except in the extreme North, where it may make a satisfactory growth
by autumn, so that &amp; hay crop may be taken from it at that time.</p>

<div class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;A crimson-clover failure on ground too poor in humus.</div>
</div>

<p>Unless the conditions of soil and moisture are exactly right it is not
an easy matter to establish a satisfactory stand of crimson clover,
even in the sections where it is most extensively produced. (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2.</a>)
The lack of timely
rains in late summer
is responsible for
most of the failures to
obtain a satisfactory
stand. The young
seedlings are very
easily killed by the
hot sun or lack of
moisture. On the
other hand, if the
seeding be delayed
too long, as, for instance, in waiting for
the proper conditions
of soil moisture, the
plants will be unable
to make sufficient
growth to withstand
the winter. Briefly
speaking, crimson clover should be seeded
shallow on a moist,
reasonably fertile,
well-drained, well-settled seed bed. Inoculation in some
form should be provided, especially
when seeding it for
the first time on any
fields in sections comparatively new to
this crop.</p>

<p>Crimson clover is not adapted to the white-clay lands in their
present condition in some portions of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.
Such fields should be seeded to soy beans or cowpeas when a leguminous
crop is desired for soil improvement or other purposes.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Crimson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6 ]</a></span>
clover does not do well on rough, newly cleared land and it ordinarily
requires the production of two or three crops or a special
preparation by liming, manuring, and inoculating before such land
presents conditions satisfactory for seeding. It is usually better to
sow rye for a winter cover and cowpeas for a summer crop if a cover
crop is thought to be needed. In any section where crimson clover
has not been previously grown the first seeding should be on a small
scale to determine whether or not it is a practicable crop for the locality
in question.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> These white-clay soils are nearly always sour, deficient In humus, and poorly drained. If limed,
subsoiled, drained, and supplied with humus, such soils are said to grow crimson clover satisfactorily.</p></div>


<h3><a id="PREPARATION"></a>PREPARATION OF THE SEED BED.</h3>

<p>The seed bed for crimson clover should be firm, moist, well settled,
and fine on top. Any efforts that may be expended to conserve the
soil moisture previous to seeding are usually justified, especially if
there be any lack of rainfall during the month previous or the month
following seeding. Where the clover is seeded in an intertilled crop,
such as corn, cotton, or tomatoes, the customary cultivation received
by these crops is ordinarily sufficient for the needs of crimson clover.
Where grain-stubble land is plowed in preparation for the clover a
month or six weeks are ordinarily required for the soil to settle sufficiently
to make a proper seed bed, since after plowing at least one
soaking rain, which compacts the soil and fills it with moisture, is
essential to the proper preparation of the seed bed for crimson clover.
If the ground be disked, a much shorter time and less rain are required
for the proper settling of the seed bed. The best method of retaining
the moisture in the seed bed is to harrow or give shallow cultivation
shortly after each rain. A fine soil mulch on the surface will
largely prevent the soil just beneath the surface from losing its moisture
through evaporation. Such surface tillage should, of course,
be given before seeding the crimson clover.</p>


<h3><a id="FERTILIZERS"></a>FERTILIZERS FOR CRIMSON CLOVER.</h3>

<p>Under the ordinary conditions of soil fertility the fertilizer applied
to the preceding crop is sufficient for the needs of crimson clover.
This is especially true where the clover follows such crops as potatoes
or tomatoes, which are ordinarily heavily treated with fertilizers that
are not entirely used up by these crops. It is important to realize,
however, that crimson clover has a very short period of growth and
that to make a vigorous growth it must have a good supply of plant
food. On sandy soils where there has been no recent application of
fertilizers it is often the practice to apply from 200 to 400 pounds of a
mixture of equal parts of acid phosphate and kainite. On clay soils
300 or 400 pounds per acre of acid phosphate are ordinarily sufficient.
If the soil be low in nitrates a light application of nitrate of soda will
assist materially in giving the young clover plants a good start and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[ 7 ]</a></span>
winter which otherwise might have proved fatal to the stand. If
the seeding has been delayed, as by waiting for suitable rains, an
application of nitrate fertilizer will stimulate the young plants and
enable them to make an increased growth before winter.</p>

<p>Any direct application of fertilizer is usually made at seeding time,
but some few farmers have been found who apply it as a top dressing
very early the following spring, giving as a reason that there is no
loss from winter leaching and that the plants are by this method
nourished at the time they are making their most vigorous growth.
Such top dressings of fertilizer should not be made while the leaves
are wet with rain or dew. Where stable manure is applied to crimson
clover very marked results follow. It may be spread just before
seeding, when the clover is not grown in an intertilled crop, or it may
be applied as a top dressing in winter or very early spring.</p>

<p>The more vigorous the growth that can be induced by the application
of suitable fertilizers the more marked will be the increase in the
yield of the succeeding crops. On soil not well supplied with humus
or plant food the use of a reasonable amount of fertilizer will often
enable a successful crop of clover and succeeding crops to be produced
where, had not the fertilizers been applied, the clover would have
failed. Furthermore, the following crop, particularly if it be corn,
would also fail to give the increased yield which follows a successful
stand of crimson clover.</p>

<p>An application of barnyard manure will be found to be especially
effective in obtaining a stand of crimson clover on any thin, galled
spots in the field. The manure should be worked into the ground
and, if possible, a second application as a top dressing should be
given such thin places to partially shade the ground from the August
sun while the seedlings are establishing themselves.</p>


<h3><a id="LIMING_SOILS"></a>LIMING SOILS FOR CRIMSON CLOVER.</h3>

<p>Most of the soils in the crimson-clover sections will be found to be
benefited by liming. Crimson clover, however, does not appear to
require lime to the extent that red clover does. Frequently on
well-drained soils in a good state of fertility the crimson clover
makes a vigorous growth without the use of lime. The stands are,
however, usually more uniformly good over the limed parts of such
fields than on the parts that have received no line. The opinion
among individual farmers appears to be about equally divided as to
whether or not it pays them to lime their soils for crimson clover.
In considering the advisability of applying lime one must not lose
sight of the need of lime on the part of such other crops as cantaloupes
or peaches, which require lime and which are either grown
with the clover or follow it. Inasmuch as the extent of the benefit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8 ]</a></span>
is somewhat uncertain it is suggested that the particular requirements
of the farm in question be determined by liming small plats
at different rates before any considerable areas are limed. The
most profitable rate of application can then be adopted for the
whole acreage.</p>


<h3><a id="INOCULATION"></a>INOCULATION FOR CRIMSON CLOVER.</h3>

<p>Fortunately most of the soils in the crimson-clover sections appear
to be already inoculated. This is especially true in sandy soil areas
where crimson clover has been grown for a number of seasons. In
sections new to this crop inoculation in some form is usually necessary.
On clay soils inoculation is not always present, even though
crimson clover may have been grown, for a number of successive
seasons on other fields of the farm.</p>

<p>An experiment conducted by the Alabama State Agricultural Experiment
Station shows how essential inoculation is on soils which
have not previously grown crimson clover. In this experiment a
yield of 4,057 pounds of crimson clover hay was secured where the
plants were inoculated, as compared with only 761 pounds where no
inoculation was provided. In another test by the same station the
inoculated plat of crimson clover yielded at the rate of 6,100 pounds
of cured hay per acre, while the uninoculated plat was a total failure.</p>

<p>Inoculation by the use of soil from a crimson-clover field is considerably
more certain than is inoculation by the use of pure cultures,
but soil inoculation is open to the danger of introducing noxious
weeds, insects, and plant diseases, especially if the soil is brought
from a distance. There is much less danger in this respect if soil
from inoculated plants can be obtained in the same neighborhood.
One very practicable method is to apply a bottle of pure culture<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
to a pound or two of the seed and sow this in the corner of some field,
or even in the garden. The resulting plants will be quite sure to be
inoculated and will furnish an abundant supply of soil for inoculating
much larger areas at the next seeding. Care must be taken
not to allow the sun to shine upon either the pure cultures or the
soil, or even on the seed after it is broadcasted. For this reason it
is safest to seed on a cloudy day or after sundown. One very satisfactory
method of soil inoculation consists merely in mixing together
equal parts of the proper soil and seed and sowing immediately in
front of the covering harrow.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Pure cultures are sent free by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Full instructions for using them
accompany each bottle.</p></div>


<h3><a id="SEEDING1"></a>SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER.</h3>

<p>Crimson clover may be sown broadcast, by hand, with a wheel-barrow
"sheep-trough" seeder, or with any of the familiar types of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[ 9 ]</a></span>
rotary seeders. It is sometimes drilled in and there are a number of
specially constructed drills designed for this purpose.</p>

<p>The consensus of opinion among farmers is that shallow seeding is
generally best, especially upon the clay soils. An inch in sandy soils
and half an inch in clay soils appears to be about the right depth
except in times of drought.</p>

<p>The ordinary rate of seeding is 15 pounds per acre, although some
use 20 pounds, while others are able to obtain satisfactory stands
with only 12 pounds per acre. One pound of seed per acre provides
for three seeds for every square foot; hence, if every seed produced
a plant, 2 pounds per acre would be theoretically sufficient to secure
a satisfactory stand. Under ordinary circumstances, however, it is
necessary to allow for some of the seed being covered too deep, while
a considerable proportion may prove to be covered too shallow for
successful growth. The principal justification of seeding such a
quantity and at varying depths lies in the fact that in case a dry
season develops after seeding the more deeply covered seeds will be
able to withstand the drought better than those covered to a medium
depth. If an unusually wet season develops, the shallow-planted
seeds will give the best results. Moreover, some of the seed will fail
to germinate. It is also well to have a fairly thick stand of the young
plants, so that the ground may be well covered even during early
fall, and thus prevent the winter-growing weeds from establishing
themselves.</p>

<p>It is held by many farmers that they are more certain of getting a
stand of crimson clover if they sow the seed in the hull rather than use
the hulled seed as it ordinarily appears on the market. It is claimed
that the hulls hold the moisture to some extent. Seed in the hull can
easily be obtained by flailing out a load of crimson clover which has
been left uncut in the field until the seed is mature. Many farmers
run the clover through an ordinary grain thrasher, which delivers the
seed in the hull.</p>

<h2><a name="VARIOUS_METHODS_OF_SEEDING_CRIMSON_CLOVER" id="VARIOUS_METHODS_OF_SEEDING_CRIMSON_CLOVER">VARIOUS METHODS OF SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER.</a></h2>


<p>Crimson clover may be seeded in late summer in any of the ordinary
intertilled crops. It may be seeded alone following any farm crop
which can be removed from the land by early summer, so that the
seed can be sown in late summer or very early fall. It may also be
seeded for hay in mixture with grain, such as wheat, rye, barley, or
winter oats, which are ready to cut for hay at about the same time as
the clover the following spring. A very light seeding of an animal
catch crop, such as buckwheat, may be made with crimson clover in
time for the catch crop to make its growth before winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10 ]</a></span></p>


<h3><a id="SEEDING2"></a>SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER IN INTERTILLED CROPS.</h3>

<p>Although crimson clover may be seeded in almost any of the intertilled
crops, in this country probably half of it is sown in corn at or
shortly after the time of the last cultivation. (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3.</a>) It is usually
possible to make such a seeding, obtain a good growth during the fall
and early spring, and mature a crop of hay in time for breaking up the
land for another crop of corn. South of the latitude of central Delaware
it is even possible to mature a crop of clover seed in time for corn
planting. In this way it is possible to grow a crop of corn each year
and at the same time steadily increase the fertility of the soil for a
series of years. Treated in this manner each succeeding crop of corn
can ordinarily be materially increased. Instances are reported where
the yield of corn has been gradually increased by this means from
10 bushels per acre at the start until as high as 70 bushels per acre
were secured.</p>

<p>The newly seeded stands of clover in corn are likely to perish if
drought occurs at or after seeding time. Tho growing corn makes
heavy demands on the soil moisture, and if there is not enough moisture
for both clover and corn the latter gets the larger share and the tender
clover plants are likely to succumb. It sometimes happens that a
very light rain shortly after seeding the clover will cause the seeds to
germinate, only to perish during the succeeding days of dry weather.
On account of the competition for moisture between the corn and
clover it is best to cover the clover seed a little deeper than is necessary
when it is sown on fallow land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11 ]</a></span></p>

<p>North, of the Potomac River the last cultivation of the corn comes
at about the right time for the best results with clover seeded at the
same time. Farther south, however, there is too much hot weather
after the corn is laid by, and as a consequence it is best to delay the
seeding of the crimson clover until about 8 or 10 weeks before the
first frost may be expected. A light furrow-toothed cultivator or
harrow may be run shallow between the rows to cover the seed.
The seed may be sown broadcast by hand or even from horseback
with a rotary seeder. In such an event, however, it is necessary to
cover the ears of the horse with small bags or socks to prevent the
entrance of the flying seed. A much more even stand is made possible
if the corn is given level tillage rather than the ridged tillage incident
to plowing with a 1-horse corn plow and ridging the land. The
appearance of a field of crimson clover seeded the summer previous
in corn is indicated in <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>.</p>

<p>In North Carolina and southern Virginia it has been found possible
under favorable conditions to obtain a satisfactory stand of clover
by seeding in cotton. The clover should not be sown until 10 or 12
weeks before frost and the last working of the cotton comes ordinarily
at an earlier date than this. It is necessary that the cotton be given
very clean culture, as well as special attention paid to conserving the
moisture in the prospective clover-seed bed. Unless the first show of
cotton is picked early it is difficult to cover the clover seed without
unduly injuring the opened cotton bolls. In the higher and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12 ]</a></span>
northern parts of the cotton belt it is possible to make the clover
seeding before the bolls begin to burst.</p>

<p>Crimson clover may be seeded in practically any of the cultivated
truck crops which receive their last cultivation from 8 to 12 weeks
before the first frost. It is not practicable to seed the clover in late
potatoes, as the digging of the potatoes in the fall practically destroys
the stand of clover. The heavy application of fertilizers necessary
for the truck crop makes possible a vigorous growth of the clover.
The result is that the soil is materially built up in both nitrogen and
humus. The clover makes its growth at a season of the year when
the land is not ordinarily occupied by any of the regular truck
crops.</p>

<p>When timely rains follow the seeding it is possible to seed the clover
on the surface of the ground among cantaloupe vines and allow
the first rain to cover the seed. The shade is apparently too dense
under watermelon vines for the clover seedlings to survive. The
writer has obtained a good stand by seeding the clover seed, without
covering, in sweet potatoes the first week in August on sandy land
near Washington, D. C. By hand-digging the potatoes with a spade
a fair stand of the clover plants was left unharmed.</p>


<h3><a id="SEEDING3"></a>SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER AFTER EARLY-MATURING CROPS.</h3>

<p>It is possible to seed crimson clover after practically any of the
ordinary farm crops which can be removed from the land three months
before frost.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to obtain anything like an ideal seed bed
for crimson clover where a field of grain stubble has been plowed
under. The soil in a stubble field is apt to be dry and cloddy when
plowed, while the stubble tends to form a dry mat at the bottom of
each furrow. Such a condition is likely to continue for a number of
weeks after plowing and to result disastrously to the clover seedlings
unless there be abundant and frequent rains. It is ordinarily a better
practice to disk the grain stubble and harrow every week, or at least
after every rain, in order to settle the ground and assist in holding the
moisture pending the time of seeding. Such frequent harrowings
will also kill the successive crops of germinating weed seeds, which
might otherwise injure the young stand of clover.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the ground from which early potatoes have been
removed is very favorable for the establishment of a stand of crimson
clover. The residual effect of the fertilizers used on the potatoes is
partially responsible for this, while the well-settled seed bed, which
requires only leveling and harrowing, also presents favorable conditions
for the crimson-clover seedlings.</p>

<h3><a id="SEEDING4"></a>SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER WITH LATE SUMMER-SEEDED ANNUAL CROPS.</h3>

<p>Crimson clover may be seeded in midsummer or in late summer
with a very light seeding of buckwheat. The buckwheat soon forms
an ideal shade for the young clover plants and unless frosts occur very
early a crop of buckwheat may usually be harvested. This method
has been suggested as being applicable when seeding the clover in
cotton. If the buckwheat is not seeded until August it will not ordinarily
produce seed in the latitude of Washington, D. C. Wherever
possible, the seeding of buckwheat and crimson clover should be
made so early that there will be time for the buckwheat to mature its
seed crop, as in this way the buckwheat itself will pay for the expense
of starting both stands. A light seeding of the buckwheat must be
made, as an ordinary stand of buckwheat shades the ground so completely
as to destroy the crimson clover.</p>

<p>Another method of preventing the injurious effect of the hot sun of
late summer is to make a light seeding of cowpeas at the same time
that the crimson clover is seeded. The cowpeas germinate promptly,
and being rather thin on the ground do not injure the stand of clover,
but on the contrary afford sufficient shade to prevent the soil from
becoming as hot as it otherwise would. In addition, the clover plants
receive some protection from the direct rays of the sun. There is
ordinarily not enough time for the cowpeas to mature, so they are
either mown for hay or left standing to catch the snow during the
winter and protect the stand of clover. In seedlings made by the
writer half a bushel of cowpeas per acre, broadcasted, gave vary satisfactory
results, the seeding being made August 1 on sandy ground
near Washington, D. C. The clover and cowpeas were sown broadcast
on early-potato ground and covered from one-half to 1 inch
deep.</p>

<p>If a light seeding of turnips be made with the clover, the turnip
plants will afford some protection to the young clover plants and at
the same time will ordinarily yield a fair crop of turnips. About 1
pound of turnip seed and 15 pounds of clover seed should be sown to
the acre. If the seeding of turnips be at all heavy the coarse-growing
turnip plants will choke out too many of the clover plants. The Cow
Horn turnips appear to be especially adapted for seeding with crimson
clover.</p>


<h3><a id="CRIMSON_CLOVER"></a>CRIMSON CLOVER IN MIXTURES WITH OTHER LEGUMES AND GRAIN.</h3>

<p>When crimson clover is seeded alone on good soil it is likely to make
so rank a growth as to lodge. To overcome this difficulty it is a common
practice to seed some small-grain crop with the clover at seeding
time. South of the Potomac River winter oats are ordinarily very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14 ]</a></span>
satisfactory, especially when seeded with the late white-blooming
strain of crimson clover. In Delaware and eastern Maryland wheat
is commonly used. In addition to wheat and oats, rye or barley
is sometimes used.
The customary rate
of seeding is about 15
pounds of clover seed
and 30 pounds of
grain per acre. The
accompanying illustration (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>) indicates the appearance
of a field seeded to
a mixture of crimson
clover and wheat.
The grain prevents
the clover from lodging, facilitates the
curing of the clover
hay, and, in addition,
forms a valuable
constituent of the
resulting hay crop.
The yield of the mixture is ordinarily
somewhat more than
when the clover is
seeded alone. The
Alabama State Agricultural Experiment
Station secured as
the average for two years' experiments the following yields of hay:</p>

</div>

<p>The grain is usually well headed but is in the milk or soft-dough stage
when the clover is ready to cut. The presence of the grain hay makes
the clover hay more easily cured. With winter oats it is usually
best to seed the late white-blooming variety of crimson clover, as the
oat crop matures somewhat later than the ordinary crimson clover.
Another advantage of this mixture is that if either should fail the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15 ]</a></span>
other will be present to serve as a cover crop during winter and bring
some return the following spring.</p>

<p>Crimson clover may be seeded in mixtures with vetch, shaftal
clover, trefoil, or, in fact, any winter-growing legume which has a
growing season similar to crimson clover. Since most of these
legumes are not upright in their growth it is usually necessary to seed
some grain crop with them to serve as a support and to prevent the
plants from lodging. The grain is ordinarily a surer crop than the
legumes and practically insures the ground being covered with some
crop during the winter and spring months.</p>


<h3><a id="SEEDING5"></a>SEEDING CRIMSON CLOVER ALONE.</h3>

<p>If a good seed bed can be prepared by August 1 in the latitude of
Washington, D. C., crimson clover will ordinarily produce a satisfactory
stand if seeded entirely alone. This is especially true on the
clay soils, where it is often difficult to obtain a successful catch in
corn at the last working. The seed is sown at the same rate as when
seeded in corn, namely, about 15 pounds per acre. It is the common
practice to broadcast the seed and to cover with a very light barrow
or weeder. Unless the August sun be unduly hot and a drought
develops, such seeding will ordinarily produce very satisfactory
results if the soil be reasonably fertile.</p>

<h2><a name="TREATMENT_OF_CRIMSON_CLOVER_STANDS_AFTER_SEEDING" id="TREATMENT_OF_CRIMSON_CLOVER_STANDS_AFTER_SEEDING">TREATMENT OF CRIMSON CLOVER STANDS AFTER SEEDING.</a></h2>


<p>Ordinarily no special treatment is required after seeding, and
before winter comes on some fall pasturage may be obtained if the
growth be sufficiently rank. A light pasturing with sheep has been
noted to induce heavier stooling on the part of the crimson clover.
Only a light pasturing with small animals, such as sheep, calves, or
chickens, should be made in either the fall or spring before the early
spring growth is well under way. If the time of seeding has been
delayed, or if for any reason it is feared that the plants will be unable
to make sufficient growth before cold weather, it has been found that
a top dressing of nitrate of soda alone or in mixture with muriato of
potash will greatly hasten the fall growth. This reduces the danger
from winterkilling and heaving out in the early spring.</p>
